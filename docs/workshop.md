# Build an event-driven data processing application using Azure iPaaS services

Welcome to this Azure iPaaS Workshop. You'll be experimenting with multiple integration services to build an event-driven data processing application.

You should ideally have a basic understanding of Azure, but if not then do not worry, you will be guided through the whole process.

During this workshop you will have the instructions to complete each steps. The solutions are placed under the 'Toggle solution' panel.

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> - You will find the instructions and expected configurations for each Lab step in these yellow **TASK** boxes.
> - Log into your Azure subscription on the [Azure Portal][az-portal] using the credentials provided to you.

# Provision resources and deploy applications
azd up
```

</details>


### Validate the setup on Azure

The provisioning step may take few minutes. Once it finishes you should have a resource group containing all resources needed in this workshop.

Moreover, you some of the applications (e.g. Azure Functions) should also be deployed and ready to be used.

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

1. On the APIM screen, in the menu on the left, click on `Products`, then click on `+ Add`.

    ![image](/docs/assets/part2-step1.jpg)

2. In the window that opens, fill in the fields with the following values and then click `Create`:
    - **Display name**: `Basic`
    - **Description**: Enter your description.
    - **Check the following boxes**:
      - `Published`
      - `Requires Subscription`

    ![image](/docs/assets/part2-step2.jpg)

3. Select the created product from the list and click on it.

4. On the next screen, click on `+ Add API`. In the right-hand menu that appears, select the API `Orders API` (the one create on the step 1) and then click `Select`.

## ðŸš€ Part 3 : Securize your API (15 minutes)

Now that we have created our products, we will learn how to secure it. We will see two methods for this: Subscription Keys and the OAuth 2.0 standard.

### Subscription Key
-----------

We will below how create the subscription keys.

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

1. On the APIM screen, in the menu on the left, click on `Subscriptions`, then click on `+ Add subscription`.

    ![image](/docs/assets/part3_1-step1.jpg)


2. In the window that opens, fill in the fields with the following values and then click `Create`:
    - **Name**: `Basic-Subscription`
    - **Display name**: `Basic-Subscription`
    - **Scope**: `Product`
    - **Product**: `Basic`

    ![image](/docs/assets/part3_1-step2.jpg)

3. For the purpose of the part 4, repeat steps 1 and 2 to create another subscription linked to the product `Premium`, with the following fields value :
    - **Name**: `Premium-Subscription`
    - **Display name**: `Premium-Subscription`
    - **Scope**: `Product`
    - **Product**: `Premium`

Now that we have created two subscriptions, each corresponding to one of our products, we can view their values by right-clicking on them and selecting `Show/hide keys`

![image](/docs/assets/part3_1.jpg)

> Be sure to note down the values of your keys to use them in the tests we will perform.

</div>

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

We will know test our API with the subscription key.


> Before continuing, go back to the `Settings` of your API and make sure the `Subscription required` checkbox is checked.

1. On the APIM screen, in the menu on the left, click on APIs, then click on the `Orders API`.
2. Next, click on the `Test` tab and copy the value under `Request URL`.
3. Open Postman, create a new request, paste the value copied in the previous step, and click on `Send`.

    ![image](/docs/assets/part3_1_ResultF.jpg)

> ðŸ”´ The result of this test is negative. A 401 Access Denied error is returned by the APIM. The error message states that the subscription key is missing.

4. In the Postman request, under the Headers tab, add the header `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` and specify the value as the key retrieved during the creation of our subscription key. Then click on `Send`.

    ![image](/docs/assets/part3_1_ResultG.jpg)

> âœ… The call is now successful with a 200 OK response.â€ƒ

</div>

### OAuth 2.0
-----------

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

We will now see how to securize our API with the OAuth 2.0 standard

1. On the APIM screen, in the menu on the left, click on APIs, then click on the `Orders API`.
2. Go to `All operations`. On the right, in the `Inbound processing` section, click on the `</>` icon to access the policy editing mode.

    ![image](/docs/assets/part3_2-step2.jpg)

3. In the `<inbound>` section and under the `<base />` tag, add the following code and click on `Save`

```xml

  <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" failed-validation-error-message="Unauthorized. Access token is missing or invalid." require-scheme="Bearer">
            <openid-config url="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{tenant}}/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
            <issuers>
                <issuer>https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{tenant}}/v2.0</issuer>
                <issuer>https://sts.windows.net/{{tenant}}/</issuer>
            </issuers>
        </validate-jwt>

```
  ![image](/docs/assets/part3_2-step3.jpg)

</div>

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

We will now see how to test our API securized by the OAuth 2.0 standard

1. Open Postman, on our previous request and click on `Send`.

    ![image](/docs/assets/part3_2_ResultF.jpg)

> ðŸ”´ The API Manager returns a 401 error. Indeed, it is now necessary to pass the token in order to be authorized to call the API.

2. On PostMan, create a new request with the following information
    - Method : POST
    - Url : `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{tenant}}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
      **TBD : how we get the tenant ??**
    - Under the Headers tab, choose the option x-www-form-urlencoded and add the following attributes with the values :
        -**grant_type**: client_credentials
        -**client_id**: **TBD**
        -**client_secret**:**TBD**
        -**scope**: **TBD**/.defaut
    - Click on Send
    - Retrieve the `access_token` returned by the identity provider.

    ![image](/docs/assets/part3_2_ResultToken.jpg)

3. Go back to the `FetchOrders` request.
4. In the `Authorization` section, choose in the `Auth Type` list the value `Bearer Token` and copy/paste the value retrieved in step 2.

5. Send the request and observe the result.

## ðŸš€ Part 4 : Change the behaviour of your API with APIM Policies (15 minutes)

In this final part of the lab, we will learn how to apply APIM policies to dynamically customize API behavior.

### Rate Limiting
-----------

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

To begin, we will set a limit for the Basic user to ensure they cannot call our API more than 5 times per minute.

1. On the APIM screen, in the menu on the left, click on `Products`, then select the product `Basic` from the list and click on it.
2. Go to `Policies`. On the right, in the `Inbound processing` section, click on the `+ Add policy` access the policy catalog.

    ![image](/docs/assets/part4_1-step2.jpg)

3. Click on the tile `rate-limit-by-key`
4. In the window that opens, fill in the fields with the following values and then click `Save`:
    - **Number of calls**: `5`
    - **Renewal period**: `60`
    - **Counter Key**: `API subscription`
    - **increment condition**: `Any request`

    ![image](/docs/assets/part4_1-step4.jpg)

5. Go back to Postman and run about ten closely spaced tests.

> Make sure to test using the subscription key corresponding to the `Basic` product.

![image](/docs/assets/part4_1-Result.jpg)

>ðŸ’¡After the first 5 calls, subsequent calls are blocked. After 1 minutes, calls become possible again.

### Monetize API
-----------

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

To conclude, we will simulate the monetization of an API using a custom policy that we will now implement.

1. On the APIM screen, in the menu on the left, click on `Products`, then select the product `Premium` from the list and click on it.
2. Go to `All operations`. On the right, in the `Inbound processing` section, click on the `</>` icon to access the policy editing mode.

![image](/docs/assets/part4_2-step2.jpg)

3. In the `<inbound>` section and under the `<base />` tag, add the following code and click on `Save`

```xml

<set-variable name="creditValue" value="{{credit}}" />
        <!-- Check if the credit value is greater than 0 -->
        <choose>
            <when condition="@(int.Parse((string)context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault("creditValue")) > 0)">
                <set-variable name="newCreditValue" value="@(int.Parse((string)context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault("creditValue")) - 1)" />
                <send-request mode="new" response-variable-name="credit" timeout="60" ignore-error="false">
