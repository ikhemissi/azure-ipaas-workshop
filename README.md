# Azure iPaaS workshop

This workshop will guide through the various steps for creating an event-driven app using Azure iPaaS services:
- Azure Functions: processing and serving data
- Logic Apps: fetching files from Storage account + data preparation
- Service Bus: communication between Azure Function Apps for better resiliency
- Event Grid: Detecting file uploads to Storage account.
- API Management: Exposing and securing APIs

In addition to these iPaaS services, we will also be using the following Azure services:
- Storage Account: storing files to process
- Cosmos DB for NoSQL: storing processed data
- Application Insights: observability
